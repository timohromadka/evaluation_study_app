# TODO
# delete directory of generated samples once session is finished?
#   - even better would be to save them to a person profile, tied to their unique account
#   - and have some sort of way of deleting unwanted samples, or only the favorited ones get kept, or similar
# loading bar of inference in real time? Possible or not? have console be printed out
# Inpainting in real time! With selector - make a second page from the start to ask what they want to do
# make accessible to users on a) same network b) internet
# get DDIM to work
# put time taken to generate the samples
# display pre generated samples with no bugs

# DONE
# display mel spectrograms too
# login and registration

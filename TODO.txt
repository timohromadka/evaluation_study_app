# TODO
# delete directory of generated samples once session is finished?
#   - even better would be to save them to a person profile, tied to their unique account
#   - and have some sort of way of deleting unwanted samples, or only the favorited ones get kept, or similar
# loading bar of inference in real time? Possible or not? have console be printed out
# Inpainting in real time! With selector - make a second page from the start to ask what they want to do
# make accessible to users on a) same network b) internet
# get DDIM to work
# put time taken to generate the samples
# move ra_ssd_2048_128 to this repo and pick out samples
- 12, 14, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 33, 36, 40, 42, 49, 53, 54, 59, 70, 72, 76, 83, 94, 97, 103, 113
